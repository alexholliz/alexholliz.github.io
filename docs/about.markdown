I'm Alex Hollis, Sr. Cloud Build Pipeline Engineer at Microsoft.

Before Microsoft, I was a DevOps Engineer working with a heavy focus on Unreal Engine Game Build Pipelines, Infrastructure Automation, and Infrastructure as Code.

I've worked in AV for live media, Webhosting and Networking for a community ISP, with deployment teams for games and web apps, on teams ranging from 3 to 30 engineers.

In my spare time, my partner and I travel and hike, I play around with live transcoding, play music, cook, and write.
