I'm Alex Hollis, DevOps Engineer at Gearbox Software working on Build Pipelines and Infrastructure.

Before Gearbox, I was a Linux Systems Engineer working with a heavy focus on Infrastructure Automation and Infrastructure as Code.

I've worked in AV for live media, Webhosting and Networking for a community ISP, with deployment teams for games and web apps, on teams ranging from 3 to 30 engineers.

In my spare time, my partner and I travel and hike, I play around with live transcoding, play music, cook, and write.
